# end-me
this took way longer than it should have.

This was made as a project for my computer science class in python. I worked on this with 2 other people (Rathiin and Aditya). This took way too much time to complete. Rathiin, Aditya and me made equal contributions to the project. It might not function as intended or at all, but that's just what you get with 3 idiots trying to do this. Ihit also has a cameo.

Contributors:
Idiot 1 - Rathiin Bharti - contributed 2 functions
Idiot 2 - Vivyan Kumar - contributed the rest of the functions
Idiot 3 - Adity G Das - stuck with debugging and organising since idiot 1 and 2 did all the code while he was away
Idiot 4 - Ihit puri - cameo moment
